# pyrocore

A collection of tools for the BitTorrent protocol and especially the rTorrent client.
They enable you to filter rTorrent's item list for displaying or changing selected items,
also creating, inspecting and changing ``.torrent`` files, and much more.

The `PyroScope` command line utilities are *not* the same as
[rTorrent-PS](https://github.com/pyroscope/rtorrent-ps),
and they work perfectly fine without it;
the same is true the other way 'round.
It's just that both unsurprisingly have synergies if used together,
and some features *do* only work when both are present.
